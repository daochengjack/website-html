# Monorepo Workspace

This repository is a modern TypeScript monorepo prepared for full-stack development. It uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) workspaces with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) to coordinate tasks across applications and shared packages.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) `>=8`
- Node.js 18 or newer

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Available commands

| Command        | Description                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`     | Run all applications in development mode via Turborepo         |
| `pnpm build`   | Build every package and application                            |
| `pnpm lint`    | Run linting across the workspace                               |
| `pnpm test`    | Execute placeholder test commands for each package and app     |

To run a single project you can `cd` into the package/app folder and run its scripts, e.g. `pnpm --filter @repo/frontend dev`.

## Project structure

```

│   ├── backend      # NestJS placeholder service
│   └── frontend     # Next.js 14 application using the app router
├── packages
│   ├── config       # Shared runtime configuration helpers
│   ├── types        # Shared TypeScript types

```

The legacy standalone HTML that previously lived at the repository root now resides in `docs/reference/` for future reference.

## Commit hooks

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) are configured to format and lint staged files before each commit. Hooks are installed automatically when you run `pnpm install`.

## Notes

- Turborepo caching is configured for build artifacts generated by the frontend, backend, and shared packages.
- Shared TypeScript path aliases are defined in `tsconfig.base.json` and can be used across the workspace (e.g. `@repo/types`).
